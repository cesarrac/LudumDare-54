One of the books in the library stands out to you.
The binding is old, the cover yellowing.
On the cover is a curious illustration of a male chef with puffy cheeks.
He kind of reminds you of Pavel.
Besides the illustration there are no other symbols or letters on the cover.
Curious you wonder what this book is and what it's doing here.:
$first:Open the book to the FIRST page.
$last:Open the book to the END.

The title is written in a language you can't understand.
You can clearly read the author though...
Anton Bobrikov

You find an inscription written on the back cover. It's in Spanish. It reads - 
"A mi compañero Leonardo. No te digo adios porque te llevo en mis tripas."
(To my partner Leornardo. Won't say goodbye, because I carry you in my stomach.)
"Y como tú me llevas en las tuyas, procura comer bien.!"
(And since you carry me in yours, please, make sure you eat well!)
[ADDBIT(leo)]
It is signed- From Anton to Leo.
