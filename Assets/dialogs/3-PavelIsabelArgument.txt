#Narrator
As soon as you enter the living room you hear them yelling.
[BITCHECK(cookbook,resolution,argument,argument)]
#argument
Pavel and Isabel are arguing in the kitchen. It's too early for yelling!
You gather your thoughts. This is the type of footage they want you to capture.:
$breathe:You take a deep breath and approach them calm and professional.
$yell:The company asked for drama? Oh. They'll get drama.
#breathe
Isabel spots you first as you walk up. She glares at you over Pavel's shoulder.
Pavel follows Isabel's eyes and turns to face you.
You're not sure if he's angrier with Isabel or at you for interrupting.
#yell
You step up between them, chest out back straight, and your fists clenched.
#resolution
You show Pavel the cook book:
$y:Do you know this person? I think they had your last name?
$n:Found this weird book in the library.
#y
Pavel's entire expression and stance change almost instantly.
#n
They both look at you, confused.
