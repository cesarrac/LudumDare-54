#producers_1
Welcome to the Space Limited team! As the newest member of our production team!
Since you were one of our last hires, we really need you to start work right away.
You’ll be placed in a production role in one of our Experience Houses, 
where you will be given tasks by the Production Manager.
We need all hands on deck for this one! 
Don’t expect to see any of the other team members though.
They will be integrated within the environment. As you will. 
All necessary information will be provided.
Here are your instructions for today:
$instruct:Check the camera placements in each member space.
Please work as fast as possible.
The Party is due to arrive soon!
