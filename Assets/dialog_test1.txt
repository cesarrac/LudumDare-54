Hello! I am the QUESTIONER! Face my wrath!
I'm here to ask you some questions.
You ready?:
$questionerAsks:Yup
$questionerSad:Not really
#questionerAsks_1
Awesome! That was my question actually...
[#questioner]
#questionerSad_1
Well that makes me quite sad...
But you know what?
[#questioner(2)]

I also have the ability to jump to a specific state
In any tag I want!
Isn't that amazing?:
$questionerSad:I don't think so
$questionerBye:Sure
#questionerBye_1
I love this new dialog system.
It makes things nice.
And cozy.
So I guess this is goodbye for now.
Unless you want to start this conversation over?:
$questioner:Yeah, let's start again.
$end:I'm good, thanks.

See ya later!
