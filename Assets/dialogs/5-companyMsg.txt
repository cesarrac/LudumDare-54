#Narrator
You find an odd message in your Inbox.
The sender used an anonymous address, a long string of numbers.
They seem to have sent the message to a select group of employees.
For some reason, you got a copy.:
$read:Read the message.
$ignore:Ignore the message and Delete it.
#read
(It seems to be an early draft for a company message from the CEO)
This is a unique moment in our organizationâ€™s history. 
Together we will sail over lands plagued by ignorance and confusion.
Together we will Navigate to greater places where this dying Earth can be forgotten.
#ignore
You delete the message inmediately.
One shouldn't take what doesn't belong to them.
